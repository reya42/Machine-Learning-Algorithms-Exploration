# Machine Learning Algorithms Exploration

This repository contains various machine learning projects, including the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Detail

1. **PCA and Naive Bayes**: This project focuses on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then using a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the target variable. The project includes data preprocessing, PCA implementation, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: This project implements the k-NN algorithm to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: This project involves implementing MLP and SVM classifiers to compare their performance on the same dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.
